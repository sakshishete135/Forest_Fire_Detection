The forest fire detection project is a system that uses sensors to detect the presence of fire and smoke in forested areas. The system is designed to provide an early warning to authorities and first responders to prevent or mitigate the damaging effects of forest fires.

The system consists of a set of sensors that are placed strategically in the forested area to detect fire and smoke. When the sensors detect the presence of fire or a certain amount of smoke, they trigger an alarm or buzzer that alerts nearby people. At the same time, a notification is sent to the authorities or first responders with the location and severity of the fire. Overall, the forest fire detection project is an important tool for preventing and mitigating the damaging effects of forest fires. It provides an early warning system that can help authorities and first responders to take timely and effective action to control the fire and prevent it from spreading further. The circuit looks like below:
